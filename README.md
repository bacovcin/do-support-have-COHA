# Description

This repository contains the source code to generate do-support with HAVE data from 
the [Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)](http://corpus.byu.edu/coha/).

The queries and the code were constructed by [Hezekiah Akiva Bacovcin](http://www.hakivabacovcin.com/) based on 
the description by [Richard Zimmerman](http://www.old-engli.sh/my-research.php).  


# Instructions

## Data

Starting in the 19th century we see a change in how tense is expressed in American English sentences with possessive HAVE (e.g., "John has a ball").
In particular, we see an increase in the use of periphrastic *do* as the element that carries
or *supports* the tense information in the sentence.

For example:

> You have not a ball.

becomes: 

> You don't have a ball.

The change towards *do*-support  progresses over the 19th and 20th centuries.
The data set generated by this repository covers the period from roughly 1810-2009.
 

## Code

To run the code either download the files as a [ZIP](https://github.com/christopherahern/do-PPCHE/archive/master.zip),
 or clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/christopherahern/do-PPCHE.git

Change directories to the cloned repository. Copy (or create symbolic links) to all of the zip files in the Word_lemma_PoS subdirectory of [the full text COHA corpus](http://corpus.byu.edu/full-text/intro.asp):

    ln -s <directory containing COHA downloads>/Word_lemma_PoS/*.zip .

Once you've structured the repository with the correct symbolic links, run the make script, which
outputs the data to `*`:

    python3 DO_HAVE_collate.py


As a point of reference, `make.sh` takes about 50min to run on a desktop running other application:

    time python3 DO_HAVE_collate.py


## Output

The data will be output to `*` with the following columns:

  1. "id" - COHA text id
  2. "startnum" - word number in file for start of token
  3. "endnum" - word number in file for end of token
  4. "dosupport" - presence/absence of DO
  6. "genre" - COHA genre code
  7. "year" - Year of publication
Note that these are all defined by the queries in `coding.c`.

The dates of the document can be found in `*`. 


# Citation

If you use this repository to generate data, please cite it. More importantly, if you use data generated
from the parsed corpus please cite [the corpora](http://corpus.byu.edu/faq.asp#cite):

Davies, Mark. (2010-) The Corpus of Historical American English: 400 million words, 1810-2009. Available online at http://corpus.byu.edu/coha/.

It takes a lot of time and effort to build and annotate historical corpora well, so it's important to acknowledge that hard work.
